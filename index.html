        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi, my name is Fatima Barajas. As an English Major, I love to read mostly fiction and fantasy in my free time. I am in my third year of college, trying to get a degree in English mainly because I enjoy learning and, of course, being a college student. I currently work in the Housing Services of the school and am enjoying the office environment and working on the computer. After finishing University, I plan to work in an office-related job, following my dreams of having a small apartment with a friendly dog and good pay. I also need a direct pathway to a job as an English major. Still, in my fourth year of University, I hope to look for internships in places I enjoy, and if anything, I wish to work in a library as every English major's dream.<br><br>

        I am an influential working person in everything that I do. I commit to everything with 100% of my energy and try my best in minimalistic things. I enjoy driving down in the traffic on Friday evenings and shopping for minimalist things, such as brownie batter or cookie mix. My new food addiction recently will be rice crackers, as they remind me of my childhood. My most recent drink addiction is officially Sunny D from Sam's. I am the youngest, second, and the only girl in my family. My family is Mexican in L.A., living paycheck by paycheck. My father recently got a job promotion, which made me happy for what was to come and how it has positively affected our family. My favorite color is jade green, as I find other greens to be like vomit. However, my minor favorite color is orange because I don't like the color orange as it does not seem attractive to me. My favorite days will have to be Wednesdays and Saturdays. I enjoy these days because Wednesdays are mostly rest days for me, and Fridays signify the end of the week. However, I want Wednesdays because, most of the time, it is the middle of the week, and we can look back on what we have done for the week and what we will continue doing. <br><br>

While I wish to have a big dog of my own, I also really enjoy pet birds and, honestly, animals. I grew up with animals all my life, so I am naturally keen on having some of my own when I can have a more stable income and living. At the moment, back home, I have four birds, two lovebirds, and two majorettes. Then we have one husky that is very food-motivated. 
I love any music; as long as I enjoy the lyrics and rhythm of a song, I will listen to and enjoy the music. I frequently hear artists Like Taylor Swift or Mylie Cyrus. However, I also want less-known artists with only one song that hits the charts and disappears, like Conan Gray, Clinton Kane, and Benson Boone. I have come to enjoy artists whose songs have meaningful lyrics behind them, such as Clinton Kane, who talks about his mother in one of his songs, and Benson Boone, who talks about his grandmother.        </p>
